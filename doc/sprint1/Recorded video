## **Practices to Continue**
- **Thorough Testing:** Check every user story and feature to ensure that it works as expected. This ensures the quality of deliverables and reduces potential bugs during integration.

## **New Practices to Introduce**
1. **Meeting Scheduling:** Plan meeting times ahead of time to ensure that all team members can participate without conflicts.
2. **Integration Verification:** Allocate dedicated time to ensure that all components are properly integrated and working together seamlessly.

## **Harmful Practices to Stop**
- **Branch Overloading:** Avoid having multiple user stories in one branch to improve focus and streamline code reviews and merging processes.

## **Best and Worst Experiences**
- **Best Experience:**  
  Working on a full-stack project, which allowed the team to gain hands-on experience with both frontend and backend components, was highly rewarding.  

- **Worst Experience:**  
  Managing multiple tasks and deadlines last minute was challenging and caused unnecessary stress. This highlights the need for better time management and early task completion.
