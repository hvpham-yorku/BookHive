# Team Organization and Tools Used
Our team connected through Discord, holding frequent discussions to decide on project topics, specifications, and tools. We selected familiar technologies for the backend, frontend, and database to streamline the development process. On Trello, we discussed and managed our user stories to define the website’s flows, with further flows being constructed on Figma.

## Decision-Making Process
We held a project decision-making meeting and an additional meeting to complete Sprint 0. Agreements on tools and APIs were reached by discussing each member’s preferences and experiences, ensuring choices aligned with project requirements.

## User Story Prioritization
User stories were prioritized and pointed by discussion and one to two rounds of voting on Trello. This approach allowed us to efficiently allocate points based on estimated complexity and effort, guiding us on which stories to implement in each sprint.

## Meeting Frequency
Although we officially held 3 meetings for Sprint 0, we continuously discussed specifications and task assignments throughout the week.

## Lessons for Future Phases
In future phases, we aim to start sprints earlier to allow more time for adjustments, bug fixes, and end-to-end testing. This project’s tight deadlines highlighted the need for better time management to ensure complete testing before each presentation. By adapting our strategies continuously, we aim to improve efficiency and output in the upcoming stages.
