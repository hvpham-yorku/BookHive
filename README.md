# Motivation 
This project aims to streamline and improve the library management system for both administrators and users. The goal is to provide a more efficient, user-friendly platform for managing library catalogs and improving the overall user experience. The system addresses common issues such as outdated catalog systems, poor user interfaces, and inefficient management practices. By creating a modern, easy-to-use system, this project enhances the management of smaller libraries and ensures a more seamless interaction for users and administrators alike.


# Installations needed
**To run this project, you will need the following tools and software:** 
**1. VSCODE** – for writing and running the Java code, API connection and React frontend.
**2. MySQL** – for database management and storing library data.
**3. React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – for the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.

# Steps to Set Up:
**1. Install Springboot:**
- Download VSCODE with springboot framework installed https://spring.io/guides/gs/guides-with-vscode.

- Set up a MySQL database for storing library information.
- Add neseccary extensions on vscode.

**3. Set Up the Frontend:**
- Ensure you have a web server running for the frontend files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript): localhost:3000
- Install the React app and add the HTML, css classes.

**4. Run the Project:**
